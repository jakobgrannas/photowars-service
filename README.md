# Photo Wars Service
A node based backend for my Photo Wars app

## Getting started

### Setup mongo db
`mongod`

In a new tab, create a database named `photo-wars`

`mongo`

`use photo-wars`

### Run the app
`nvm use && npm install`
`npm run dev`

Now you can make a call to an endpoint, like
`http://localhost:5066/user/add`
